# WarForMithia
This is my portion of my Senior Capstone Project: War For Mithia. In this WEBGL build you can find the story of the game, and an opening cinematic that was created for the game as well. All the voice actors did an amazing job and I'm really glad they get to see their hard work make it onto the internet.

The files are too big to upload as a WEBGL so if you wish to see what is in store for the project, you can download the executable off my google drive. Link below.
